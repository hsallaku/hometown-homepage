                    <p> The Kruja Castle overlooks the picturesque town of Kruja. The fortress houses two museums: the Ethnographic Museum and Soviet-era Skanderbeg Museum, containing exhibits on the revered Albanian military leader. Visitors will also find the remains of a mosque, church, and a medieval hammam.</p>

                    <p class="activity-box-title">Hiking Mt. Kruja</p>
                    <p>This hike is considered moderate due to its elevation. You will reach the top of Kruja Mountain 1117m, part of Skanderbeg Mountain Range, starting your walk at approx. 600m above sea level, making your hike intense due to the elevation gain of 500 m in a short distance. Time: 1 h 45 minutes one way. This is a wide trail with very rocky terrain but the reward is amazing - you will enjoy amazing VIEWS throughout this trail!</p>
